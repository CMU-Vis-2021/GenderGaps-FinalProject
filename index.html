          The <b>Theil index (represented by redness)</b>is a statistic used to measure economic
          inequality. The Theil index measures an entropic "distance" the
          population is away from the "ideal" egalitarian state of everyone
          having the same income. The numerical result is in terms of negative
          entropy so that a higher number indicates more order that is further
          away from the "ideal" of maximum disorder. Formulating the index to
          represent negative entropy instead of entropy allows it to be a
          measure of inequality rather than equality.

          Dark orange represents female dominant gender gap
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that for the majority of the country, males make more than females.
           The gender gap is skewed towards males. This is incredibly upsetting.
          If we analyze the map further, we can see that the east coast is less slightly 
          more gender equal than the west coast and midwest. You might ask why this is the case? 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is something we found really interesting. After considering multiple explanations 
          for why this is the case, we hypothesized that low incomes are a significant part that 
          low income jobs weigh more heavily towards female success rate being higher than male 
          success rate. This hypothesis is most consistent with our next finding (reversal of 
          gender gap at the 25th percentile)

          This data compares people’s wages at age 30 compared to their parent’s
          income percentile. This graph demonstrates the apparent income gender
          gap that exists at all different parent income percentiles. At every
          parent income percentile, females make lower wages than males. Super
          upsetting right! In fact, this gap becomes wider at higher income
          levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that males are employed at lower rates than females at lower parent 
          income percentiles. However, we see an interesting reversal at about the 25th parent 
          income percentile mark where a higher percentage of males are employed than females.

          <b>Comparing NY vs. NC employment rate by sex</b>
          <p>
            For children coming from the lowest quantile of household income,
            there an employment rate gender gap later in life. <br /><br />
            But this gap in employment rate is greater in some states than in
            others. For example ... [text about NC having a larger gender gap
            than NY]

            The regional differences in these gender gaps are closely correlated
            with commonly accepted proxies for neighborhood disadvantage.
            <br /><br />
            For example,
            <span style="color: green"
              >North Carolina's greater high school dropout rate</span
            >
            is closely correlated with its greater gender gap for lower income
            childhoods. (Note for team: it's turning out to be difficult to
            create transitions for cicles AND their label text, so the MVP right
            now will have to be labelling the circles some other way. : / )

            That gender gap is also closely correlated with the fraction of
            black citizens claiming residence in that city. For example,
            <span style="color: green"
              >North Carolina's larger black population</span
            >
            is closely correlated with its greater gender gap for lower income
