            The <b>Theil index </b>is a statistic used to measure economic
            inequality. The Theil index measures an entropic "distance" the
            population is away from the "ideal" egalitarian state of everyone having
            the same income. The numerical result is in terms of negative entropy so
            that a higher number indicates more order that is further away from the
            "ideal" of maximum disorder. Formulating the index to represent negative
            entropy instead of entropy allows it to be a measure of inequality
            rather than equality.

        <h4>Comparing NY vs. NC employment rate by sex</h4>
        For children coming from the lowest quantile of household income, there
        an employment rate gender gap later in life.
        <br /><br />
        But this gap in employment rate is greater in some states than in
        others. For example ... [text about NC having a larger gender gap than
        NY]

        <h4>Comparing NY vs. NC high school dropout rate</h4>
        The regional differences in these gender gaps are closely correlated
        with commonly accepted proxies for neighborhood disadvantage.
        <br /><br />
        For example,
        <span style="color: green"
          >North Carolina's greater high school dropout rate</span
        >
        is closely correlated with its greater gender gap for lower income
        childhoods. (Note for team: it's turning out to be difficult to create
        transitions for cicles AND their label text, so the MVP right now will
        have to be labelling the circles some other way. : / )

      <div class="case_circles" id="circles3">
        <h4>Comparing NY vs. NC black population size</h4>
        That gender gap is also closely correlated with the fraction of black
        citizens claiming residence in that city. For example,
        <span style="color: green"
          >North Carolina's larger black population</span
        >
        is closely correlated with its greater gender gap for lower income
        childhoods.
