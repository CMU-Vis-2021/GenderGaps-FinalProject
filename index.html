          The <b>Theil index (represented by redness)</b>is a statistic used to
          measure economic inequality. The Theil index measures an entropic
          "distance" the population is away from the "ideal" egalitarian state
          of everyone having the same income. The numerical result is in terms
          of negative entropy so that a higher number indicates more order that
          is further away from the "ideal" of maximum disorder. Formulating the
          index to represent negative entropy instead of entropy allows it to be
          a measure of inequality rather than equality.

          Dark orange represents female dominant gender gap
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that for the majority of the country, males make more than
          females. The gender gap is skewed towards males. This is incredibly
          upsetting. If we analyze the map further, we can see that the east
          coast is less slightly more gender equal than the west coast and
          midwest. You might ask why this is the case?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is something we found really interesting. After considering
          multiple explanations for why this is the case, we hypothesized that
          low incomes are a significant part that low income jobs weigh more
          heavily towards female success rate being higher than male success
          rate. This hypothesis is most consistent with our next finding
          (reversal of gender gap at the 25th percentile)

        <p>
          This data compares people’s wages at age 30 compared to their parent’s
          income percentile. This graph demonstrates the apparent income gender
          gap that exists at all different parent income percentiles. At every
          parent income percentile, females make lower wages than males. Super
          upsetting right! In fact, this gap becomes wider at higher income
          levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that males are employed at lower rates than females at
          lower parent income percentiles. However, we see an interesting
          reversal at about the 25th parent income percentile mark where a
          higher percentage of males are employed than females.

        <h3>New York vs. North Carolina employment rate</h3>
        <div class="case_text" id="emp_rate">
          <p>
            As we saw in the above scatter plot, children growing up in the
            lowest quantile of household incomes experience an employment rate
            gender gap later in life in which women actually have higher
            employment rates than men. <br /><br />
            For a small case study, lets take a look at the employment rates of
            men and women in two very different states, New York and North
            Carolina.
            <br /><br />
            You can see that for the first quantile of parent incomes, this gap
            is present in both states. But are there other factors that
            correlate with gaps like these? And what other factors correlate
            with the larger gender gap in North Carolina?

        <h3>Comparing NY vs. NC high school dropout rate</h3>
        <div class="case_text" id="dropout">
          <p>
            The regional differences in these gender gaps are closely correlated
            with commonly accepted proxies for neighborhood disadvantage,
            especially factors that are tied to race and histories of segregated
            communities and education systems.
            <br /><br />
            For example, North Carolina has a significantly higher high school
            dropout rate when compared to New York. This is closely correlated
            with its greater gender gap for lower income childhoods, and this
            correlation holds across other states as well.

        <h3>New York vs. North Carolina black population size</h3>
        <div class="case_text" id="pop_black">
          <p>
            Another factor with a very close correlation to the employment
            gender gap for first-income-quantile childhood environments is a
            region's fraction of black citizens claiming residence there.
            <br /><br />
            For example, North Carolina's larger gender gap for lower income
            childhoods is closely correlated with its larger black population.
            <br /><br />
            These are just a few of the segregation and economic
            opportunity-related factors with a close correlation to the gender
            gap, but we hope the point has been made clear that disadvanted
            neighborhoods consistently are sources of the type of employment
            gender gaps shown above in the scatter plot.
